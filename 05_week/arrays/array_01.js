// Initial array of team members
//let teamMembers = ["John", "Emily", "Mike", "Sarah"];

// Exercise 1: Loop through `teamMembers` and log each name to the console.
// Write your code here:

// Exercise 2: Remove the first member of the array.
// Write your code here:
let teamMembers = ["John", "Emily", "Mike", "Sarah"];
//teamMembers.shift();
//console.log(teamMembers);

// Exercise 3: Remove the last member of the array.
// Write your code here:
/*teamMembers.pop();
console.log(teamMembers); */
// Exercise 4: Add a new member "Alex" to the front of the array.
// Write your code here:
/*teamMembers.unshift("Alex");
console.log(teamMembers); */

// Exercise 5: Append a new member "Linda" to the end of the array.
// Write your code here:
/*teamMembers.push("Linda");
console.log(teamMembers); */

// Exercise 6: Create a new array that excludes the first two members.
// Write your code here:
/*teamMembers.splice(0, 2);
console.log(teamMembers); */
// Exercise 7: Find the index of "Mike" in the array.
// Write your code here:
/*const index = teamMembers.indexOf("Mike");
console.log(index); */

// Exercise 8: Try to find the index of "Jake" (who is not in the array).
// Write your code here:

/*let index = teamMembers.indexOf("Jake");
console.log(index); */

// Exercise 9: Use `splice` to remove "Mike" and add "Carol" and "Bruce" in his place.
// Write your code here:
/*teamMembers.splice(2, 1, "Carol", "Bruce");
console.log(teamMembers); */
// Exercise 10: Concatenate a new member "Bob" to the end of the array and create a new array.
// Write your code here:

// const newTeamMembers = teamMembers.concat('Bob');
//console.log(newTeamMembers);

// Exercise 11: Using `slice` to Copy the Entire Array
// Write your code here:
//const copy = teamMembers.slice();
//console.log(copy);

// Exercise 12: Combining Arrays with `concat`
// Assume `newMembers` array is defined
//let newMembers = ["Tina", "Dean"];
// Write your code here:

// const newArray = teamMembers.concat(newMembers);
// console.log(newArray);

// Exercise 13: Finding all occurrences of a John
// Write your code here:
// const filteredJohn = teamMembers.filter((element) => element == 'John');
// console.log(filteredJohn);

// Exercise 14: Transforming members with `map` to be all written uppercase
// Write your code here:
// const membersUpperCase = teamMembers.map((element) => element.toUpperCase());
// console.log(membersUpperCase);
